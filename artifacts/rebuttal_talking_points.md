# Rebuttal Talking Points (prepared 2026-05-23)

## B1 (Q3): Difficulty-dependent contamination defense
**审稿人可能追问**: difficulty × model_type 交互效应下，direction reversal 仍可被 contamination 解释。
**Defense**: "We have now formally tested the difficulty × model-type interaction with two complementary analyses: (1) Logistic regression confirms the interaction is significant (OR = 4.75, p < 10⁻¹⁸⁸; N = 8,585 items); controlling for difficulty, model type remains a strong independent predictor (OR = 4.24, p < 10⁻²²⁵). (2) Mixed-mechanism semi-synthetic simulation reproduces the overall ρ and χ² reversal, but cannot replicate the near-zero instruct gradient (simulated ρ = −0.302 vs. observed −0.079, a 3.8× gap that persists across all tested parameters). This residual gap is evidence that instruct-model DIF is at least partially driven by non-contamination mechanisms (e.g., alignment-induced capability shifts)."

## B5 (Q6): ≥500 threshold
**审稿人可能追问**: K=3 的 power 是多少？最低需要多少模型？
**Defense**: "K=3 and K=5 yield near-identical power: TPR difference < 0.02 across all 30 conditions (within Monte Carlo noise). At N ≥ 80, K=3 achieves TPR = 0.454–0.571, AUC = 0.905 at N = 100 (Table 5). Smaller corpora can therefore use fewer strata with no power loss, confirmed empirically rather than assumed from prior literature."

## B8: Size-stratified DEFF
**审稿人可能追问**: 为什么不用 tier-specific DEFF？哪个 tier 的 C% 才对？
**Defense**: "Table A.3 provides size-stratified DEFF: tier-level ICC decreases monotonically from 0.246 (2–10 members) to 0.082 (>200 members), confirming that mega-families drive the weighted estimate's conservatism. At small family sizes DEFF correction has negligible impact (Adj. C% = 31.3%); the 13.5% lower bound is driven entirely by the two mega-families. This empirical size–ICC gradient directly undermines the homogeneity assumption underlying the weighted-mean variant, supporting the simple-mean estimate (~29%) as the more appropriate correction."

## Negative results framing
| Result | Framing | Strength |
|--------|---------|----------|
| AUROC=0.60 | Emergent cohort-item interactions, not fixed defects | 4/5 |
| R²=0.0007 | Exclusion evidence (domain improvement ≠ DIF) | 5/5 |
| ρ=-0.597 diagnostic limit | DIF is diagnostic lens, not causal detector | 4/5 |
| Jaccard=0.206 | Orthogonal constructs (core contribution) | 5/5 |
