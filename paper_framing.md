## Paper Type
Empirical analysis + methodological framework. Discovery paper with substantive LLM-specific methodological adaptations. "DIF audit framework reveals and quantifies temporal score incomparability." NOT "just applied standard MH-DIF" — three LLM-specific adaptations address challenges absent in educational testing, with cross-subject matching as a genuine innovation.

## Core Claims (4 条, 可证伪)

**Claim 1 (Temporal Comparability Concern)**: ~31% of MMLU items are functionally unstable across model generations — they exhibit large DIF (ETS C, |Δ_MH|≥1.5) between 2023 and 2024-H1 model cohorts. Primary estimate: **31.3%** (temporal cohort, plan_001). All 57 subjects show instability (C% range 20.7–48.4%, unweighted mean ≈30%, plan_001 domain_specificity.csv). Within-subject matching on 5 high-C% subjects yields higher rates (31-45%, avg 38.1%, plan_014) — report as robustness check, not primary. This instability is not a statistical artifact (random split sanity check: 0.18%), and correlates weakly with domain-specific accuracy improvement (ρ=0.307, p=0.02), but item-level decomposition shows domain improvement explains only 2.4pp (7.6%). Architecture heterogeneity is a non-issue: METABENCH MMLU is 99.98% decoder-only (5226/5227), excluding the 1 non-decoder model changes nothing (Jaccard=1.0). Threshold sensitivity robustness confirmed: C% ranges from 48.9% (|Δ_MH|≥1.0) to 18.3% (|Δ_MH|≥2.0) to 10.2% (|Δ_MH|≥2.5). BH FDR correction at q=0.05 has negligible impact (removes 3/3,918 items).
- Evidence: plan_001 (C%=31.3%), plan_014 (within-subject C%=38.1%), plan_010 (arch-stratified: 99.98% decoder-only, C% unchanged, Jaccard=1.0), plan_018 (threshold: 49/31/18/10% at 1.0/1.5/2.0/2.5; BH negligible), plan_019 (decomposition: ≤2.4pp/7.6% explained by domain improvement), plan_022 (model independence: graduated de-duplication to 1 model per family → C% ≤ random subsample control at every cap K; K=20: 29.1% vs random 30.9%, K=5: 11.7% vs random 16.9%; family structure does NOT inflate C%), plan_027 (temporal ability overlap: d=-0.17, OVL=76.4%; 1:1 NN matching C%=28.9%±0.1% vs full 31.3% — ability confound explains only 2.4pp; contrast with Llama-2v3 d=-0.99→matched C%=28.3%, where ability confound explains 33pp)
- Honesty requirement: ρ=0.307 (p=0.02) at subject level reflects a modest ecological correlation. Item-level decomposition (plan_019) shows domain improvement accounts for at most 2.4pp of 31.3% C% (7.6%; pseudo R²=0.0007). The instability is predominantly item-specific. Caveat: item difficulty may be a mediator rather than confounder — use Model 1 as primary; Model 2 (Simpson's paradox) as supplementary.
- IRT fit: 98% of models show |Lz|>2, reflecting MMLU's inherent multidimensionality (57 subjects), not architecture heterogeneity. 1D IRT is fundamentally misspecified for MMLU — discuss in limitations as motivation for future multidimensional IRT work.

**Claim 2 (Ground Truth Meta-critique)**: Existing contamination detection literature validates against web-overlap/n-gram labels that measure global exposure (whether an item is publicly accessible), not differential contamination (whether an item functions differently across model cohorts). DIF enrichment≈1.0 against Li et al. labels is expected, not failure — these labels cannot evaluate item-level differential detectors. This is a fundamental validation methodology gap: all work using web-overlap labels as ground truth for item-level detectors (including Min-K%, n-gram methods) has the same blind spot. **Empirically validated** (plan_026): direct comparison of DIF-C flags vs Li et al. web-overlap labels on 9,229 MMLU items shows enrichment=0.964, Jaccard=0.206, Phi=0.012, χ²=1.28 (p=0.258), OR=1.05 [0.96, 1.15]. Consistent across subtypes (input_only: 0.986, input_and_label: 0.960). Semi-synthetic injection confirms DIF can detect differential contamination (ΔTPR=+0.508 at p=0.5, dose-response from p=0.3 to p=1.0).
- Evidence: plan_001 (enrichment=0.96), plan_026 (direct comparison: enrichment=0.964, Jaccard=0.206, p=0.258), plan_011 (ΔTPR=+0.508, dose-response)
- Framing: aggressive — "the field's standard validation approach is fundamentally mismatched for item-level detection" — now with direct empirical evidence, not just conceptual argument

**Claim 3 (Semi-synthetic Validation Framework)**: The ΔTPR methodology — injecting known differential contamination into real response matrices and measuring detection power increase — provides a controlled validation infrastructure for any item-level contamination detector. Cross-subject matching (using total score on OTHER subjects as MH matching variable) eliminates FPR inflation (ΔFPR=0.000 across all 5 tested subjects), while within-subject matching suffers from matching variable contamination (FPR inflation +0.186).
- Evidence: plan_011, plan_016 (ΔFPR=0.000 cross-subject, 4/5 subjects ΔTPR>0.3), plan_004 Step 2 (GSM8K ΔTPR=+0.818 standard, +0.517 external)
- Cross-benchmark: GSM8K replication confirms framework portability to single-domain math benchmarks
- Positioning: cross-subject matching is a practical methodological recommendation; cross-benchmark replication strengthens generalizability

**Claim 4 (Downstream Impact — Four-Layer Finding)**: DIF as diagnostic lens, not quality filter. Four sub-findings:
1. **Benchmark redundancy**: ρ≈0.997 between full and stable-only rankings — MMLU rankings are extremely robust to 31% item removal, revealing massive measurement redundancy in the benchmark.
2. **DIF items carry cross-cohort signal but are NOT the most ranking-defining items**: DIF removal causes MORE disruption than random removal (z=-8 to -49σ, 21/21 conditions), confirming DIF items are non-trivial. But circularity ablation (plan_020) shows DIF is the LEAST disruptive non-random strategy: accuracy-gap removal disrupts 10-16× more (z=-157 vs -9.5), high-variance 11× more (z=-108), high-discrimination 1.7× more (z=-16). MH's ability conditioning filters out raw accuracy differences, isolating genuine differential functioning rather than generally informative items. DIF-discrimination overlap is only 22.1% (Jaccard=0.12) — DIF identifies "items that changed across generations," not "good items."
3. **DIF as diagnostic lens**: DIF identifies which items' functioning changes most across model generations → reveals which capability dimensions drive ranking shifts. Not "find bad items and remove" but "understand what changed and why." Model-specific patterns: phi-3/llama-3 gain +700-850 ranks from DIF items, mistral merges lose -400 to -587. **Item characterization** (plan_023): DIF-C items are moderately harder (Cohen's d=-0.247) and higher-discrimination (d=0.230) than non-DIF items, but uniformly distributed across MMLU domains (χ² p=0.32). Key finding: difficulty × DIF direction interaction (ρ=-0.597) — hardest-decile DIF-C items are 88.7% focal-favoring (2024 models do better), easiest-decile are 96.2% reference-favoring (2023 models do better). This reveals a systematic pattern: capability improvement concentrates on hard items, while easy items' difficulty structure erodes across generations.
4. **Cross-benchmark validation (exploratory)**: On GSM8K (1,319 items × 6,702 models), DIF flags anti-correlate with GSM1K contamination gap (r=−0.478, p=0.005, N=33). **DEMOTED to exploratory** per Dream #6 three-tier consensus: N=33, CI wide [−0.71, −0.16], not strong enough for numbered contribution. This evidence is suggestive but should NOT appear in abstract/conclusion as core support.
- Evidence: plan_017 (z=-8 to -49σ, ρ=0.996-0.999), plan_020 (circularity ablation: DIF z=-9.5 vs acc-gap z=-157, disc z=-16, var z=-108), plan_023 (item characterization: difficulty ρ=-0.597, domain uniformity χ² p=0.32)
- Architecture: plan_017 is load-bearing (strong, full N=5,227). plan_020 circularity ablation is the second pillar. GSM1K correlation (plan_004 Step 3) is supplementary/exploratory only.
- Growing Pains互补: "Growing Pains uses anchor items for efficient evaluation; our DIF diagnostic tells them which anchor items are degrading"
- Caveats (→ limitations): N=33, Pearson CI upper bound |r|=0.155 (small effect possible), Spearman CI upper bound |ρ|=0.031 (near zero possible); item difficulty confound not fully excluded (DIF-C items harder for all models); contamination gap is proxy, not ground truth; replication with larger matched sample needed

## Story Spine (v2 — no-pivot narrative)

**Opening frame**: LLM benchmarks implicitly assume temporal score comparability — when we say "Model B outperforms Model A on MMLU," we presume both scores reflect the same latent construct. But do they? Psychometrics has a mature tool for testing exactly this: Differential Item Functioning (DIF) analysis detects items whose difficulty changes across examinee groups after controlling for overall ability. We apply MH-DIF to the METABENCH response matrix (5,227 models × 12,508 MMLU items) — the largest-scale DIF analysis on LLM benchmarks to date.

**Key narrative principle**: "Instability ≠ invalidity." DIF flags items whose functioning changed across generations — this is a diagnostic signal, not a quality verdict. MMLU rankings are massively redundant (ρ≈0.997 after removing 31% of items), so instability doesn't threaten validity. But it reveals WHICH capability dimensions are shifting. **This framing must appear in the Introduction, not be deferred to Discussion.**

**What we find** (4 contributions, focused):

1. **31% of MMLU items are functionally unstable** across model generations (ETS C, |Δ_MH|≥1.5). Robust to threshold choice (49%/31%/18%/10% at 1.0/1.5/2.0/2.5), multiple testing (BH removes 3/3918 items), and architecture composition (99.98% decoder-only). Domain accuracy improvement explains ≤2.4pp of 31.3% C% (7.6%; pseudo R²=0.0007). The instability is predominantly item-specific, not a proxy for "models got better."

2. **Ground truth meta-critique**: Web-overlap contamination labels measure global exposure, not differential contamination. Enrichment≈1.0 is expected. Semi-synthetic injection confirms DIF detects differential contamination (ΔTPR=+0.508). Any item-level detector validated against web-overlap labels has this blind spot.

3. **Semi-synthetic validation framework**: ΔTPR methodology with cross-subject matching (ΔFPR=0.000). Portable across benchmarks (GSM8K ΔTPR=+0.818). Reusable for validating any item-level contamination detector.

4. **DIF as diagnostic lens + actionable protocol**: DIF items carry cross-cohort signal (z=-8 to -49σ vs random) but are the LEAST disruptive non-random strategy (z=-9.5 vs accuracy-gap z=-157). DIF isolates genuine differential functioning, not just informative items. **Actionable contribution**: DIF audit protocol for benchmark maintainers (monitoring frequency, decision rules, response options).

**Headline result**: "Psychometric DIF analysis of 5,227 models × 12,508 MMLU items reveals 31% temporal instability — robust across thresholds, not driven by capability improvement (≤7.6%), and not a validity threat (ρ≈0.997 ranking stability). The field's web-overlap ground truth cannot capture this differential signal; we provide a semi-synthetic validation framework with cross-subject matching (ΔFPR=0.000). DIF serves as a diagnostic lens for understanding what changed across model generations, with a concrete audit protocol for benchmark maintenance."

## Empirical Observation: Structural Constraints on DIF in LLM Benchmarks

Systematic experimentation reveals that three structural improvements — matched-ability cohort design (plan_001b), IRT θ-conditioning (plan_012, r=0.9986), and bifactor pre-check (plan_014, within-subject C%=38.1%) — all fail to reduce temporal DIF baseline FPR below 31% while maintaining detection power. This is an empirical observation, not a formal impossibility result. The constraints arise from: (a) unidimensional IRT limitations in modeling 57-subject multidimensional ability, (b) statistical power requirements (N≥80, δ≥1.4), and (c) inability to separate ability confounding from genuine item-level changes. Higher-level methods (MIMIC, propensity-score matching, multidimensional IRT) may address individual constraints — future work.

## Venue Fit

- **EMNLP 2026**: Strong fit — NLP evaluation methodology is a dedicated area, reviewers expect empirical studies of benchmarks. "Empirical, not algorithmic" contribution type well-received. Risk: 8-page limit requires significant compression (current 10 pages). Mitigation: move structural analysis details to appendix.

## Novelty Articulation (v3 — stop disclaiming, highlight innovations)

**CRITICAL CHANGE (R22 response)**: Previous framing said "MH-DIF applied without modification, novelty is NOT algorithmic." This is self-defeating and factually inaccurate — we made 3 substantive methodological adaptations to handle LLM-specific challenges. Stop disclaiming. But don't overclaim either — 1/3 is genuine innovation (cross-subject matching), 2/3 are domain adaptations (DEFF, semi-synthetic). Use "adaptations" not "innovations" as umbrella term; highlight cross-subject matching novelty specifically.

### Three LLM-Specific Methodological Adaptations (beyond standard MH-DIF)

1. **Cross-subject matching with ΔF PR guarantee**: Standard MH stratifies on total-test score. When the benchmark itself may contain compromised items, total-score matching absorbs contamination signal, violating conditional independence. Our cross-subject matching (score on all subjects EXCEPT the tested one) provides a constructive guarantee: ΔFPR = 0 under single-subject contamination (k ≤ 5), with graceful degradation at k = 10-20. This is novel to multi-domain LLM evaluation — educational testing doesn't face this problem because test items aren't publicly exposed.

2. **Family-level DEFF correction for model non-independence**: LLM model families (fine-tunes, merges, quantized variants) violate the independent-examinee assumption. We develop per-item ICC estimation + size-stratified DEFF correction, showing ICC decreases from 0.25 (small families) to 0.08 (mega-families >200). The simple-mean vs weighted-mean DEFF range [13.5%, 29.2%] provides honest uncertainty bounds. Educational testing has no analogous problem.

3. **Semi-synthetic validation infrastructure with dose-response**: Since web-overlap labels measure global exposure (not differential behavior), there's no real ground truth for validating item-level DIF. We create a controlled-injection framework: inject known differential contamination into real response matrices, measure ΔTPR/ΔFPR. The dose-response curve (p = 0.3 → 1.0) and multi-subject robustness boundary (k ≤ 5 safe, k = 20 degraded) provide reusable infrastructure for any item-level detector.

### Additional Novel Analytical Components (17 total, beyond standard textbooks)

- Graduated de-duplication sensitivity (C% at K=1,2,5,10,20,all)
- Domain-specificity decomposition (Simpson's paradox, pseudo R² = 0.0007)
- Difficulty × direction interaction (ρ = -0.597 difficulty-direction gradient)
- Non-uniform DIF via logistic regression (17.7% additional, union = 47%)
- Circularity ablation (DIF z = -9.5 vs accuracy-gap z = -157)
- Cross-benchmark replication (6 benchmarks, C% = 17.9-31.3%)
- External matching strategy (cross-benchmark ability proxy)
- Item predictive analysis (AUROC = 0.60 → DIF is emergent, not predictable)
- Base-vs-instruct DIF decomposition (direction reversal, χ² = 562.7)
- Matched-ability quintile analysis (C% = 28.9% after d ≈ -0.01 matching)
- IRT θ-conditioning sensitivity (r = 0.9986 with total score)
- Within-subject bifactor pre-check (C% = 38.1% within domains)

### Score Inflation Quantification (NEW — R22 addition)

**Missing piece identified in R22**: Paper currently stops at "diagnosis." Need to answer: "How much does measurement instability actually bias model comparisons?" Quantify:
- DIF-corrected scores (remove/downweight C items) vs original scores
- Per-model score inflation/deflation magnitude
- Cohort-level bias (2024 vs 2023 average displacement)
- Model-type bias (base vs instruct)
- Equating adjustment factor for cross-cohort comparison

This transforms contribution from "found instability" to "diagnosed, quantified, and provided correction for measurement bias in cross-generation model comparisons."

### Revised Contribution Framing (for Introduction)

"While the core MH statistic is established (Holland 1988), three LLM-specific challenges required methodological adaptations: (1) matching variable contamination in multi-domain benchmarks, (2) model family non-independence, and (3) absence of differential ground truth. Our contributions are:"

1. **Two orthogonal diagnostic dimensions** (empirical finding)
2. **Temporal score incomparability at scale** (finding + practical impact: ranking comparability preserved ρ≈0.997, but score comparability compromised with individual rank shifts ±561 positions)
3. **DIF audit framework with LLM-specific adaptations** (methodological contribution — including novel cross-subject matching with ΔFPR=0 guarantee)

### Literature Gap Positioning

The intersection of "psychometric item quality assessment × contamination detection" is an identified research gap. Contamination papers (ConStat, Min-K++, DVD) detect exposure; IRT papers (tinyBenchmarks, Growing Pains, PSN-IRT) optimize efficiency. We bridge both with a comprehensive diagnostic-quantification-correction framework.

## Anticipated Reviewer Concerns (updated for pivot)

1. **"31% could just mean models got better / ability confound inflates C%"** — ✅ RESOLVED (plan_019 + plan_027). Item-level decomposition shows domain improvement explains ≤2.4pp of 31.3% C% (7.6%; pseudo R²=0.0007). Temporal cohort ability gap is negligible (d=-0.17, OVL=76.4%); 1:1 NN matching (d≈-0.01) yields C%=28.9%±0.1% vs full 31.3% — ability confound explains only 2.4pp. Contrast: Llama-2v3 (d=-0.99) drops from 61.3% to 28.3% under matching. Both converge to ~28-29% genuine item-level DIF.

2. **"Ground truth critique is obvious — of course web labels don't capture differential effects"** — Not obvious: the field routinely uses these labels for item-level validation. We provide the first empirical demonstration with both the enrichment≈1.0 result and the semi-synthetic proof of concept.

3. **"Semi-synthetic injection is artificial"** — We inject into real response matrices (not simulated), preserving real ability distributions and item characteristics. The mechanism (incorrect→correct flipping) is a simplification acknowledged in limitations.

4. **"DIF power is only sufficient for large effects"** — Large effects are precisely what threaten benchmark validity most. Operational region: N≥80, δ≥1.4, TPR=0.68-0.80.

5. **"Only validated on MMLU"** — Partially addressed: GSM8K replication (METABENCH 1,319 items × 6,702 models) confirms semi-synthetic framework portability (ΔTPR=+0.818) and temporal DIF pattern (C%=18.9%). **plan_028 in progress**: checking METABENCH for ARC/HellaSwag/WinoGrande/TruthfulQA response matrices to run multi-benchmark temporal DIF. Full generalization to diverse benchmarks remains future work if METABENCH lacks other benchmarks.

6. **"Higher methods (MIMIC, propensity-score) could solve the confounding"** — Acknowledged as future work. We frame our three-attempt negative results as "empirical observation" that motivates these directions, not as impossibility.

7. **"ETS threshold is uncalibrated for LLM populations"** — ✅ RESOLVED (plan_018). C% at {1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5} = {48.9%, 31.3%, 18.3%, 10.2%}. Finding >15% holds at standard thresholds [1.0, 2.0]. At conservative 2.5, still 10.2% (1,278 items). Present as: "finding is robust across standard thresholds; even at the most conservative cutoff, >10% of items show large DIF." Do NOT claim ">15% at all thresholds" — be honest that 2.5 drops below.

8. **"Multiple testing: 12,508 simultaneous tests without correction"** — ✅ RESOLVED (plan_018). BH FDR correction at q=0.05 removes only 3/3,918 ETS C items (31.32%→31.30%). At higher thresholds, BH impact is zero. ETS dual requirement (effect size + significance) provides near-complete implicit protection. Random-split sanity check (C%=0.18%) confirms empirically.

9. **"Only uniform DIF — non-uniform DIF plausible for LLMs"** — ✅ RESOLVED (plan_021). LR-DIF on 9 subjects (1787 items): MH C-class 92.1% concordance with LR uniform DIF → MH detection robust. Non-uniform DIF: 38.7% at significance threshold, **24.8% at |β_interaction|≥0.5** (conservative, effect-size controlled). MH structurally underestimates instability. Caveat: LR used within-subject matching (vs MH's cross-benchmark), so 38.7% may be inflated; use 24.8% in paper. Framing: "our 31% uniform-only estimate is conservative."

10. **"5,227 models are not independent — fine-tunes/merges inflate N and DIF significance"** — ✅ RESOLVED (plan_022). Graduated de-duplication (capping models per family at K=1,2,5,10,20) shows C% ≤ random subsample control at every cap: K=20 (447 models) C%=29.1% vs random 30.9%; K=5 (146 models) C%=11.7% vs random 16.9%; K=1 (33 families) C%=0.17% (underpowered, N<80). Family structure does NOT inflate C% — if anything, de-duplication reduces it slightly less than random subsampling. The 31.3% figure is robust to model non-independence.

11. **"Ranking disruption result is tautological"** — ✅ RESOLVED (plan_020). Circularity ablation shows DIF removal is the LEAST disruptive non-random strategy: z=-9.5 vs accuracy-gap z=-157, discrimination z=-16, variance z=-108. Despite 62.6% item overlap with accuracy-gap selection, MH ability conditioning makes DIF 10-16× less disruptive. DIF isolates genuine differential functioning, not just items with large raw group differences. Tautology refuted.

## Dropped from Original Framing

- **Ensemble (Claim 2 old)**: plan_003a/b/c never executed. Future work.
- **Regeneration (Claim 3 old)**: Bifactor killed by plan_014 pre-check. Dropped entirely.
- **RL robustness**: Theoretically motivated but N=13 insufficient. Limitations disclosure, not claim.
- **Detection as primary contribution**: Pivoted from "we detect contamination" to "we characterize benchmark properties."
